# Own Voice Assistant(SARA)

The Voice Desktop Assistant is a Python-based application that lets users interact with their computer using simple voice commands. It listens to what the user says, converts the speech into text, understands the command, and then performs the required action while replying with voice output.

The assistant can carry out tasks such as opening websites, searching the internet, telling the current time and date, getting information from Wikipedia, and telling jokes. It uses speech recognition to understand voice input and text-to-speech technology to respond naturally to the user.

This project shows the practical use of Python automation, voice processing, and basic artificial intelligence concepts. It is developed as a beginner-friendly academic project and demonstrates how voice-controlled systems can make human–computer interaction easier and more convenient.
